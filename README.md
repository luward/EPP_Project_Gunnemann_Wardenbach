# EPP_Project_Gunnemann_Wardenbach

This repository contains a jupyter notebook and materials on the EPP project by Alyssa Gunnemann and Luis Wardenbach. We added scalar benchmark functions aswell as a problem set consisting of several smaller problem sets of different dimension to estimagic. Our work can be found in [this](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/estimagic/pull/271) pull request. Please activate the estimagic conda environment from the estimagic repository before running the notebook.
